# mintokenizers
`mintokenizers` is a minimal learning project for tokenizers and their usage, based on Karpathy's great `minbpe` project and his amazing video on tokenizers. I created this project to learn more about tokenizers and how they can be used in natural language processing.

## What is mintokenizers?

`mintokenizers` is a collection of notebooks and code snippets that explore the world of tokenizers, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. My goal is to provide a gentle introduction to the concepts and techniques of tokenization, making it accessible to anyone interested in natural language processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with `mintokenizers`, simply clone this repository and navigate to the `notebooks` directory. Each notebook is designed to be a self-contained tutorial, covering a specific aspect of tokenization.

## What's Included

* Notebooks: `bpe.ipynb` and `sentencepiece.ipynb`
* Data: `taylorswift.txt` (a sample text file used in the notebooks)
* Code snippets: Various code snippets throughout the notebooks to illustrate key concepts

## Acknowledgments
